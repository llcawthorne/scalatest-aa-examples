# scalatest-aa-examples
Just some code from ScalaTest and ScalaCheck examples presented by Alvin Alexander's blog

Well, actually, the ScalaTest examples are from 
[these blogposts](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/scalatest-tutorials-from-scala-cookbook) and
the ScalaCheck examples are from [this repo](https://github.com/alvinj/FPScalaCheck.git).  He plans
to talk about the ScalaCheck examples in his book in progress, 
"Learning Functional Programming in Scala", but it wasn't in the last draft I read.
